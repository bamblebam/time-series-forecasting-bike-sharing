# Time Series Forecasting Bike Sharing
Using the london bike sharing dataset to learn about time series forecasting.  

### Data Visualisation
By looking at the data it is obvious that the number of bike shares is greater during the summer months. Also the plot aginst the hourly data has 2 peaks at morning and evening possibly due to work/school. Though during holidays the numbers are greater during the afternoon. The numbers also fall during the weekends. This needs to be taken into account when building the model.
